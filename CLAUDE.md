# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Project Is

**Skrift** is a macOS desktop app for transcribing iPhone voice recordings (.m4a) and Apple Notes exports to text using MLX-accelerated Parakeet, then sanitising (name linking), enhancing (local MLX model), and exporting to Obsidian-compatible Markdown — all offline.

Architecture: Electron + React frontend (`frontend-new/`) communicates with a FastAPI Python backend over HTTP on `localhost:8000`.

---

## Commands

### Run (development)

```bash
# Double-click to open in Terminal (sources full shell env, starts backend + Electron dev mode)
open '/Users/tiurihartog/Hackerman/Skrift/Open Skrift New.command'

# Or manually:
cd frontend-new && npm run dev:electron   # Vite dev server + Electron concurrently

# Stop backend
cd backend && ./start_backend.sh stop
```

### Frontend only (from `frontend-new/`)

```bash
npm run dev            # Vite dev server only (no Electron)
npm run dev:electron   # Vite dev server + Electron (full dev mode)
npm run build          # TypeScript check + Vite production build → renderer-dist/
npm run build:electron # Full build + electron-builder → dist-electron/Skrift-*.dmg
npm run type-check     # TypeScript check (no emit)
npm run lint           # ESLint with auto-fix
```

### Backend only (from `backend/`)

```bash
./start_backend.sh start     # Start (resolves deps from user_settings.json or defaults)
./start_backend.sh stop
./start_backend.sh restart
./start_backend.sh status
```

Backend runs on `http://localhost:8000`. API docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Building a distributable

```bash
cd frontend-new && npm run build:electron
# Output: dist-electron/Skrift-0.1.0-arm64.dmg
# App icon: /Users/tiurihartog/Hackerman/Skrift/Icons/Skrift_icon_light.icns
```

The packaged app spawns the backend via `bash -l backend/start_backend.sh start` (login shell so Homebrew PATH is available). Falls back to `~/Hackerman/Skrift/backend/start_backend.sh` if relative path not found.

**Important:** `start_backend.sh` resolves its own location via `BASH_SOURCE`, reads the dependencies path from `config/user_settings.json`, and exports `/opt/homebrew/bin` so `ffmpeg` is always available. On first launch it auto-creates the Python venv if not present.

## Architecture

### Backend (`backend/`)

FastAPI app with routers split by domain:

| Router | Prefix | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `api/files.py` | `/api/files` | Upload, list, delete audio/note files |
| `api/transcribe.py` | `/api/process/transcribe` | Trigger Parakeet transcription; supports `force` flag to re-transcribe |
| `api/sanitise.py` | `/api/process/sanitise` | Name linking (returns 409 on ambiguous aliases) |
| `api/enhance.py` | `/api/process/enhance` | MLX text enhancement, model management, tags |
| `api/export.py` | `/api/process/export` | Compile + export to Markdown/Obsidian |
| `api/batch.py` | `/api/batch` | Batch enhancement jobs with SSE streaming |
| `api/system.py` | `/api/system` | Resource monitoring, health check |
| `api/config.py` | `/api/config` | Read/write user settings, dependency detection/setup |

Business logic lives in `services/`:
- `transcription.py` — Parakeet-MLX transcription (in-process, model cached as singleton between calls). Audio preprocessing via ffmpeg: high-pass filter + `afftdn` adaptive denoiser + EBU R128 loudness normalization. Produces `word_timings.json` by merging BPE sub-word tokens into whole words. **Parakeet loads from local files only — never downloads from HuggingFace.**
- `sanitisation.py` — Name linking and disambiguation logic
- `enhancement.py` — MLX model invocation (streaming SSE); auto-unloads after 10s idle in manual mode
- `export.py` — Markdown/Obsidian compilation; reads `export.attachments_folder` for image destination
- `batch_manager.py` — Batch enhancement queue: Title → Copy Edit → Summary → Tags → Compile, SSE broadcast of tokens, MLX model stays loaded throughout batch, unloads on completion
- `mlx_runner.py` + `mlx_cache.py` — MLX model singleton cache; survives between calls within a session
- `apple_notes_importer.py` — Apple Notes `.md` export parser; sets `source: Apple-Note` in frontmatter

**Batch transcription** (`/api/batch/transcribe/start`) processes files sequentially via `process_transcription_thread` (parakeet-mlx). The frontend sidebar currently calls `/api/process/transcribe/{id}` per file individually instead.

**Batch enhancement** (`/api/batch/enhance/start`) works correctly — calls enhancement service directly, keeps MLX model hot, broadcasts tokens via SSE at `GET /api/batch/enhance/stream`.

`utils/status_tracker.py` — heartbeat-style status files stored as `status.json` per file in the output folder.

`config/settings.py` — `Settings` class with dot-notation access (`settings.get('transcription.parakeet_model')`). User overrides persisted to `~/Library/Application Support/Skrift/user_settings.json`. On first launch, seeds from `config/user_settings.template.json` (clean, no personal paths).

**Key settings paths:**
- `export.note_folder` — Obsidian vault root
- `export.audio_folder` — vault subfolder for voice memos
- `export.attachments_folder` — vault subfolder for images/attachments (falls back to vault root if empty)
- `enhancement.tags` — `{ max_old, max_new, selection_criteria }`
- `transcription.noise_reduction` — afftdn noise floor in dB (-10 = aggressive, -30 = gentle, 0 = off)
- `transcription.highpass_freq` — High-pass filter cutoff in Hz (0 = off, 80 = default)

**Dependency detection API** (`/api/config/deps/*`):
- `GET /deps/detect` — scans ~/Skrift_dependencies, ~/Downloads, ~/Desktop for valid deps folder or `.zip` files
- `GET /deps/validate?path=...` — checks a folder for venv, MLX models, Parakeet model
- `POST /deps/extract` — extracts a `.zip` to ~/Skrift_dependencies, validates
- `POST /deps/apply` — saves deps path, auto-selects first MLX model

**File storage layout:**
```
~/Documents/Voice Transcription Pipeline Audio Output/
└── [file_id]_[filename]/
    ├── original.m4a          # or original.md for Apple Notes
    ├── processed.wav         # denoised + normalized audio fed to Parakeet
    ├── compiled.md
    ├── status.json           ← single source of truth for all state
    ├── word_timings.json     # word-level timestamps for karaoke
    ├── image_manifest.json   # (optional) timestamped photo offsets from mobile
    └── images/               # (optional) photos captured during recording
        ├── photo_xxx_001.jpg
        └── photo_xxx_002.jpg
```

**Health endpoint:** `GET /api/system/health` returns `transcription_modules.parakeet.available`.

### Frontend (`frontend-new/`)

Entry: `src/main.tsx` → `App.tsx`

`App.tsx` is the shell — manages selected file, seekTo state for karaoke, first-launch detection, and renders:
- `SetupWizard` — first-launch setup (auto-detects deps zip/folder, extracts, configures)
- `Sidebar` — file list, multi-select with batch actions, upload
- `NoteDisplay` — note body (contenteditable) + karaoke text overlay
- `Inspector` — right panel: transcription, cleanup, enhancement, export controls

**First-launch detection:** On mount, checks `GET /api/system/health`. If backend is unreachable, parakeet unavailable, or deps not configured, shows the `SetupWizard` overlay instead of the old Settings-in-setup-mode.

**Setup wizard** (`src/features/SetupWizard.tsx`):
- Step 1: auto-detects `Skrift_dependencies.zip` in Downloads/Desktop, or an existing extracted folder. One-click extraction to `~/Skrift_dependencies`. Also supports manual folder/zip browse.
- Step 2: author name, Obsidian vault paths (notes/audio/attachments). All optional, skippable.
- On complete: saves all config to backend, dismisses wizard.

Key files:
- `src/api.ts` — `api` singleton + `API_BASE` export, all HTTP calls to `http://localhost:8000`. Also exports `DEFAULT_PROMPTS` (should match backend `settings.py` defaults) and types (`DepsValidation`, `DepsZip`, `EnhancePrompt`, etc.)
- `src/types/pipeline.ts` — `PipelineFile` interface, `SystemHealth` type
- `src/hooks/useSettings.ts` — `AppSettings` with localStorage cache + backend as single source of truth. **Backend config returns nested dicts** — always use `(config as any)?.export?.note_folder`, never `config['export.note_folder']`.
- `src/components/SystemStatus.tsx` — 2 dots: Backend / Parakeet
- `src/components/KaraokeText.tsx` — word-level highlight; zero padding on all tokens (toggling padding breaks line wrapping); click-to-seek via `onSeek` prop
- `src/components/NoteBody.tsx` — contenteditable; floating toolbar on text selection for adding names; `AddNameModal`; renders `![[image.jpg]]` as inline `<img>` (max-width 400px) via backend image serving endpoint
- `src/components/DisambiguationModal.tsx` — shown on 409 from sanitise
- `src/features/Sidebar.tsx` — multi-select mode; batch Transcribe (calls `startTranscription` per file) and Enhance (calls `startEnhanceBatch`); progress bar + SSE token stream for enhance; stale `checked` IDs pruned on file list change
- `src/features/Inspector.tsx` — `localTagSuggestions` seeded from `file.tag_suggestions` on poll update (so batch-generated tags appear without clicking "Suggest Tags")
- `src/features/NoteDisplay.tsx` — NoteBody always mounted, hidden during karaoke (preserves edits)
- `src/features/Settings.tsx` — pure preferences UI (no setup mode). Close button always visible.
- `src/features/settings/PathsTab.tsx` — "Local folders" and "Obsidian vault" sections
- `src/features/settings/TranscriptionTab.tsx` — Engine info, model name, audio preprocessing sliders (noise reduction, high-pass filter)
- `src/features/settings/EnhancementTab.tsx` — `TagSettings` component (max_old, max_new, selection_criteria textarea). **Config reads use nested access** (`(config as any)?.enhancement?.tags`).

### Electron (`frontend-new/electron/`)

- `main.cjs` — main process; spawns backend via `bash -l`; uses `fs.existsSync` to fall back to absolute repo path; registers `file://` protocol for audio playback; `dialog:openUpload` IPC opens native picker accepting files and folders; `dialog:openFiles` supports `accept` filter (e.g. `['zip']`)
- `preload.cjs` — contextBridge exposing `electronAPI` to renderer

### Design system

Colors use space-separated RGB values in CSS variables (e.g. `--color-primary: 37 99 235`) so Tailwind's alpha modifier works (`bg-primary/10`). Never use comma-separated values. Dark mode tokens are defined under `:root.dark`.

### Config architecture — single source of truth

**The backend is the single source of truth for all configuration.** The frontend uses localStorage only as a fast startup cache, and always overwrites it with backend values on mount.

Key rules:
- Backend `GET /api/config/` returns a **nested** dict (e.g. `{ "export": { "note_folder": "..." } }`)
- Frontend must use nested access: `(config as any)?.export?.note_folder` — **never** dot-notation keys like `config['export.note_folder']`
- `DEFAULT_PROMPTS` in `api.ts` must stay in sync with `settings.py` defaults. When no user overrides exist in `user_settings.json`, the frontend fetches backend defaults via `/api/config/defaults` and uses those.
- `user_settings.template.json` is the clean seed for new installs (no personal paths). The developer's `user_settings.json` is excluded from the DMG build.
- `names.json` is also excluded from the DMG build. If missing, sanitisation defaults to empty people list.

### Sanitise flow

Sanitise can return HTTP **409** when an alias maps to multiple people. `api.startSanitise()` handles 409 as a valid response and calls `groupOccurrences()` to transform the flat backend `occurrences` array into grouped `Ambiguity[]` for the disambiguation modal.

### Transcription pipeline

Parakeet-MLX is the sole transcription engine. Audio preprocessing: ffmpeg high-pass → afftdn adaptive denoiser → EBU R128 loudness normalization → 16kHz mono WAV. The Parakeet model is cached as a singleton (loads once, stays in memory). **Parakeet uses local model files only — never downloads from HuggingFace.** Model files must exist in `{dependencies_folder}/models/parakeet/` (HF cache structure). Progress is reported via `chunk_callback` for long files. Force-retranscribe deletes `processed.wav` so preprocessing runs fresh with current denoiser settings.

Sub-word BPE tokens from Parakeet are merged into whole words using leading-space detection before writing `word_timings.json`.

### Enhancement pipeline

**Models — smart routing per task:**
- `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-4bit` (~15 GB) — default, used for **vision** tasks (photo descriptions in copy-edit). MoE architecture: 26B total, 4B active per token.
- `gemma-4-e4b-it-8bit` (~8.4 GB) — lighter model, auto-detected and used for **text-only** tasks (title, summary, tags, importance, text-only copy-edit).

The backend auto-routes based on `step` parameter + whether the file has images (`image_manifest.json`). Model selection is in `_resolve_text_model_path()` in `enhancement.py`. The cache (`mlx_cache.py`) supports `force_vlm=True` to load via `mlx_vlm` for vision tasks, and calls `mx.metal.clear_cache()` on unload to prevent Metal memory leaks.

**Prompts** (defined in `backend/config/settings.py` `DEFAULT_SETTINGS.enhancement.prompts`):
- `copy_edit` — minimal cleanup, preserves English/Dutch mixing, collapses speech stumbles/self-corrections, removes filler words. Does NOT rephrase or restructure.
- `vision_copy_edit` — for segments with photos: cleans text AND weaves in one factual observation from the photo as a natural clause.
- `summary` — 1–3 sentences, matches primary language of text.
- `title` — 5–15 words, matches primary language.
- `importance` — 0.0–1.0 score (shown in Inspector as colored bar).

**Two-phase vision copy-edit** (for files with timestamped photos):
- Phase 1 (Vision): Load 26B as VLM, describe each photo in one sentence. SSE progress: "Analyzing photo 1/5..."
- Phase 2 (Text): Load E4B as text-only, single copy-edit pass with photo descriptions injected as `[Photo N: description]` hints. Model weaves them into the text and removes the markers.

Single file: Title → Copy Edit → Summary → Tags (manual approval) → Compile. `steps.enhance` is set to `done` only after compile runs with all parts present (including approved tags). Streaming uses SSE with progress events (`phase`, `status`, `vision_progress`).

Batch: same steps via `batch_manager`. Tags are generated as `tag_suggestions` (not auto-approved). `steps.enhance` stays pending until user approves tags per file. **Progress bar in sidebar tracks `enhanced_title && enhanced_summary` being set** (not `steps.enhance === done`) so it fills when LLM work is done.

### Apple Notes import

Dropping or selecting a folder via `+ Upload`:
- Electron's `dialog:openUpload` IPC returns both file paths and folder paths
- Folder paths sent as `note_folder_paths` JSON field in FormData
- Backend `apple_notes_importer.py` parses the `.md`, extracts title/date/content, sets `source: Apple-Note`
- Images referenced in the note are resolved to `export.attachments_folder` on export

Dragging a single `.md` file also works (treated as a note file).

### People / names config

`backend/config/names.json` — schema:
```json
{ "people": [{ "canonical": "[[Full Name]]", "aliases": ["Nick"], "short": "Nick" }] }
```
Edited via Settings → Names in the UI. **No duplicate aliases** — duplicates cause false ambiguity in sanitise (409 for a name that shouldn't be ambiguous). File is excluded from DMG build; if missing, defaults to empty list.

---

## External dependencies

All heavy dependencies live **outside the repo** in a configurable dependencies folder (default `~/Skrift_dependencies/`):
- `mlx-env/` — Python venv with FastAPI, parakeet-mlx, mlx-lm, mlx-vlm (auto-created by `start_backend.sh` on first launch)
- `models/parakeet/` — Parakeet TDT v3 model weights (HF cache structure, **local only — no auto-download**)
- `models/mlx/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-4bit/` — primary model (26B MoE, vision-capable via mlx-vlm)
- `models/mlx/gemma-4-e4b-it-8bit/` — lighter fallback model (text-only tasks, faster)

The path is configurable via `settings.get('dependencies_folder')`. `start_backend.sh` reads it from `config/user_settings.json` at startup.

`ffmpeg` must be on PATH — installed via Homebrew at `/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg`. `start_backend.sh` prepends `/opt/homebrew/bin` to PATH at startup to ensure this works in all launch contexts.

### Distribution

The distribution folder (`~/Desktop/Skrift-Distribution/`) contains:
- `Skrift-0.1.0-arm64.dmg` — the Electron app (no personal config baked in)
- `Skrift_dependencies.zip` — models (~25 GB): `models/mlx/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-4bit/` + `models/mlx/gemma-4-e4b-it-8bit/` + `models/parakeet/`
- `setup.sh` — backup/alternative setup script (installs Python, ffmpeg, creates venv)
- `README.txt` — setup instructions

**New user flow (zero manual steps):**
1. Download DMG + `Skrift_dependencies.zip` to Downloads
2. Install app (drag to Applications)
3. Open app → backend auto-creates Python venv (first time, ~2-5 min)
4. Setup wizard auto-detects zip in Downloads → click "Set up" → extracts to `~/Skrift_dependencies`
5. Wizard step 2: set author name, Obsidian vault paths (optional)
6. Done — no terminal, no `setup.sh` needed

**DMG build excludes:** `user_settings.json`, `names.json` (via `package.json` `extraResources` filter). Seeds from `user_settings.template.json` on first launch.

The `mlx-env/` venv is NOT distributed (path-specific); `start_backend.sh` bootstraps it automatically. The Parakeet model is pre-bundled in the zip (no HuggingFace download).

### Model comparison scripts

`backend/scripts/` contains test scripts for comparing models and prompts:
- `compare_gemma_qwen.py` — side-by-side Gemma vs Qwen output comparison
- `compare_prompts.py` — test different prompt versions
- `test_stumbles.py` / `test_stumbles2.py` — test speech stumble cleanup
- `test_refined_prompts.py` — test refined prompt set
- `test_thinking.py` — Gemma 4 E4B thinking vs no-thinking comparison
- `test_vision_enhancement.py` — full vision pipeline test with real images

### Photo capture (mobile → desktop pipeline)

Users can take timestamped photos during voice recording on the mobile app. The flow:
1. **Mobile**: Camera preview during recording, shutter button captures photos with timestamp offsets
2. **Sync**: Audio + images + `image_manifest.json` sent as multipart upload
3. **Transcription**: `_insert_image_markers()` inserts `[[img_XXX]]` markers at word boundaries matching photo timestamps
4. **Enhancement**: Two-phase vision copy-edit (26B describes photos → E4B edits text with descriptions)
5. **Export**: `[[img_XXX]]` → `![[title-slug_XXX.jpg]]` Obsidian embeds, images copied to `export.attachments_folder`

Mobile app key files:
- `mobile/contexts/RecordingContext.tsx` — shared recording state between tab layout and record screen
- `mobile/app/(tabs)/record.tsx` — camera preview + shutter (CameraView must have ZERO React children to avoid Fabric crashes)
- `mobile/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` — tab bar record/stop button
- `mobile/app/review.tsx` — photo filmstrip with timestamps
- `mobile/lib/storage.ts` — `copyPhotosToRecordings()`, `imageManifest` in metadata
- `mobile/lib/sync.ts` — sends images as multipart `images` field
